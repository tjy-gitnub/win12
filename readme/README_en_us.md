## Introduction

Recently (a long time ago), inspired by the concept of Windows 12 (Powered by PowerPoint), I decided to create a web version of Windows 12, similar to [Win11 in React](https://win11.blueedge.me/).

Consultation [Preview](#preview).

Beautiful ui design, smooth and rich animations, various advanced features (compared to the web version).

> Adaptation for mobile is not too perfect, just use desktop `>v-)o`
