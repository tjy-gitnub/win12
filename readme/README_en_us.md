## Foreword

A long time ago, tjy-gitnub was inspired after seeing the Windows 12 concept version (Powered by PowerPoint) and decided to create a Windows 12 web version, just like the [Windows 11 web version](https://win11.blueedge.me/). It features beautiful UI design, smooth and rich animations, and various advanced features.

Thus this project was born (yes, the birth of this project was just that sudden)

> The mobile adaptation is not very complete yet, so please use the desktop version website for now `>v-)o`

## Online Experience

## Feature Preview

> The new version has many changes. This is for reference only. Please refer to the actual product (you can click [here](https://tjy-gitnub.github.io/win12/desktop.html) to see for yourself, no trouble `-_-)o` )
