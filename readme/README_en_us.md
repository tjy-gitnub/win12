千古有冬夏，一载经春秋。破浪长风扶摇起，夜深星源起处。
天涯何处觅知音，春秋冬夏君相昔。
一路有你，纵冰塞黄河，雪满太行，不畏，丈夫未可轻年少。
愿我如星君如月，夜夜流光相皎洁。

## Introduction

Recently (a long time ago), inspired by the concept of Windows 12 (Powered by PowerPoint), I decided to create a web version of Windows 12, similar to [Win11 in React](https://win11.blueedge.me/).

Consultation [Preview](#preview).

Beautiful ui design, smooth and rich animations, various advanced features (compared to the web version).

> Adaptation for mobile is not too perfect, just use desktop `>v-)o`

It's a little slow. Wait a minute.

## Installation And Use

Download the code, no need to install, just open `desktop.html`.
