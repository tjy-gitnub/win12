Introduction
Long ago, after seeing the Windows 12 Concept Edition (Powered by PowerPoint), the author tjy-gitnub was deeply inspired and decided to create a Windows 12 Web Edition, similar to Windows 11 Web. It features a beautiful UI design, smooth animations, and various advanced functions.

Thus, this project was born (yes, it started quite suddenly).

[!NOTE]
